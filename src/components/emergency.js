            <h1>What to do in an emergency</h1>
            <p>A diabetic emergency happens when symptoms <strong className='see'>relating to diabetes overwhelm the body</strong>.At this point, home treatment is unlikely to help, and delaying medical care could cause permanent damage or death.Some of the signs that can indicate a serious problem include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chest pain that radiates down the arm.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Difficulty breathing.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Fever</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Severe headache and weakness in one side of the body.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Seizures.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Loss of consciousness.</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>If there are signs of an emergency, the person should go to the emergency room, or they or someone with them should call 911 immediately.</h3>
            <p>Without rapid help, some diabetic emergencies can be life-threatening.</p>
        <h1>Prevention:</h1>
        <p>It is not always possible to prevent an emergency, but being able to recognize the signs can improve the chances of early treatment and a full recovery.</p>
        <p>Strategies that can help to reduce the risk of an emergency include:</p>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Following the treatment plan:</strong>Use medications as a doctor prescribes and keep in touch with the healthcare team. If a person cannot remember whether or not they took their last dose of drugs, they should ask a doctor before taking a further dose. This can help to prevent hypoglycemia. Anyone who notices a change in their symptoms should see a doctor.</li> 
           <li><strong>Eating healthful, balanced, regular meals:</strong> People who use insulin or other medications that lower blood glucose should ask their doctor about what foods to eat, how much, and when, in order to maintain stable blood sugar levels. Small, frequent meals are better than fewer larger meals.</li> 
           <li><strong>Limiting alcohol and sugary drinks:</strong> These drinks contain carbs, which can raise blood sugar and contribute to obesity. Alcohol consumption can also increase the risk of other health conditions.</li> 
           <li><strong>Treating infections early:</strong> Diabetes can compromise the immune system and the bodyâ€™s organs, making it easier for infections to develop. Prompt treatment can prevent minor problems from becoming more serious.</li> 
           <li><strong>Exercising regularly:</strong> Exercise helps the body control blood sugar. It can also help with symptoms that often accompany diabetes, such as high blood pressure, obesity, and poor circulation.</li> 
        </ul>
        <h1>Planning for an emergency:</h1>
        <p>No specific medication or procedure can stop a diabetic emergency once it occurs, but emergency planning can increase the chances of getting prompt help.</p>
        <p>People with diabetes should:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Let their friends know they have diabetes.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>
            Wear a medical ID so that people will know what to do in an emergency.
            </strong></li>
            <li><strong>Keep a mobile phone charged and ready to contact emergency responders.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Know who to call with questions about diabetes emergencies.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Outlook:</h1>
        <p>Diabetes is a serious and complex condition, and an emergency can arise for various reasons.Managing the condition through medication and a healthful lifestyle, ensuring that others know the person has diabetes, and learning as much as possible about diabetes and its complications can reduce the risk of an emergency arising.</p>
